# the most important thing:
How do I test this?
1. download FS19_simpleIC.zip and add to modfolder
2. download my Agrostar 6.61 Edit I released for christmas, it already has simpleIC added. https://youtu.be/lsEg6T7XOkE
3. go ingame and have fun :D 

# What this is:
This is a new take on the well known Interactive Control Scripts in Farming Simulator. Since there hasn't been a well-working bug-free version of the old scripts in FS19, and since I always didn't like the way the Mouse is used, I created this alternative.

- This is a global script, which means that it doesn't have to be added to each Mod seperately, no additional modDesc.xml changes like l10n Texts etc. neccessary.
- Obviously the vehicle-xml and i3d still has to be edited, the script can't magically seperate doors and add trigger-points. But as soon as the needed lines are added, IC will be active as long as you have this mod active.
- this also means that people who don't like IC don't have to remove it all vehicle-mods, just not activate this mod.
- this also means that there's only one IC version and not 50 different ones that get into conflict with each other 
- updates to IC are global and useable in all mods

Now for the bad parts
- still Beta
- still Bugs
- not even close to the amount of features the original IC Script had in FS17. (But I'm working on that ;) )

# How to add this to my Mod:
- I will create videos explaining the process of adding simpleIC to your vehicle. 

If you already know modding well, here's a short explanation:
(look at the linked Deutz Agrostar above to see the full XML lines)

- outsideInteractionTrigger = playerTrigger in which the player can open doors and other outside-stuff from the outside
- animationName = name of the animation for the door
- animationSpeed = speed of the animation (obvious) 
- shared animation = not added yet
- soundVolumeIncreasePercentage = by how much will the sound-volume increase if that door is opened. Values will be added together for more than one door, max is outdoorSoundVolume 
- insideTrigger and outsideTrigger = "Triggerpoints" e.g. transformGroups that mark the spot where the IC component can be clicked
- triggerPoint = index / i3dMapping name for the transformGroup
- triggerPointSize = size/radius around the triggerPoint where it still registeres as being clicked
